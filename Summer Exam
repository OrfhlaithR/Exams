#Question 2
#Student Name: Orfhlaith Ryan
import random #allows random numbers to generate

guess = 0 #this is so the input doesn't ask the user twice before the loop actually starts

number = random.randint(1,50) #generates a random number between 1 and 50

while guess != number: #while loop as unsure as to how many times user will be asked
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 50: "))
    if guess > number:
        print("Too high, try again") #prints when the guess is too high
    if guess < number:
        print("Too low, try again") #prints when guess is too low
print("You win") #this prints when user is correct
